---

## Machine Learning Models

### Ridge Regression Architecture

The system employs dual Ridge Regression models with optimal hyperparameters:

**Home Goals Model** (`ridge_home_model.pkl`)
- Target variable: Home team goals
- Alpha regularization: Optimized via cross-validation
- Feature space: 21+ normalized features

**Away Goals Model** (`ridge_away_model.pkl`)
- Target variable: Away team goals
- Alpha regularization: Optimized via cross-validation
- Feature space: 21+ normalized features

### Model Training Process

1. **Data Collection**: Historical match data with 21+ features
2. **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization
3. **Cross-Validation**: K-fold CV for hyperparameter tuning
4. **Model Fitting**: Ridge Regression with optimal alpha
5. **Serialization**: joblib persistence for production deployment

### Prediction Methodology

```python
# Scaled feature preparation
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X_features)

# Apply feature weights
X_weighted = X_scaled * feature_weights

# Dual model prediction
predicted_home_goals = ridge_home_model.predict(X_weighted)
predicted_away_goals = ridge_away_model.predict(X_weighted)

# Post-processing
predicted_total_goals = predicted_home_goals + predicted_away_goals
goal_difference = predicted_home_goals - predicted_away_goals

# Outcome classification
if goal_difference > threshold:
    outcome = "Home Win"
elif goal_difference < -threshold:
    outcome = "Away Win"
else:
    outcome = "Draw"
```
